This is my second big project based on a course i'm taking Udemy, it's a website for recording fictional sales and fictional sellers (whose names are based mixing some of my friends names irl). The difference between these two projects is that the teacher is using a much older version of the framework, while im using the latest one by the writing of this readme (.NET 7.0); by doing this, i'm not just copying the project, but actually trying to bring the project to a newer version, it has been challenging but rewarding! After i finish it and assure that it's working as intended, i'll try to add some more features and master CSS skills to improve the visuals of the website. Thank you for reading.
